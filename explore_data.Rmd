```{r setup, include=FALSE}

train <- read_csv("data-raw/train.csv")

```

# `train.csv`

From [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data), here is a breakdown of the variables in the training data, `train.csv`.

![Kaggle data dict](images/kaggle-data-dict.png)\

Here's what the data look like in `R`:

```{r summary}
# the kable() function in knitr makes nice tables
knitr::kable(head(train))
summary(train)
```

Let's check out some boxplots of the continuously-valued variables (PassengerId, Age, and Fare) grouped by survival status:

```{r boxplots, fig.width=7, fig.height=3}
# shape data and make boxplots 
train %>%
  select(Survived, PassengerId, Age, Fare) %>%
  # outlier here stretches out the scale out for the "Fare" subplot 
  filter(Fare < 300) %>%
  # reshape data
  gather("variable", "value", -Survived) %>%
  # make factors for easier ggplot functionality
  mutate(Status = factor(ifelse(Survived, "Survived", "RIP")),
         variable = factor(variable)) %>%
  # plot that ish
  ggplot(aes(x = Status, y = value, fill = Status)) + 
    geom_boxplot() + 
    scale_fill_manual(values = c("#FC4E07", "#00AFBB")) + #colors
    facet_wrap(~variable, scales = "free_y") + # facet by variable
    # theme stuff, remove legend and vertical gridlines
    theme_minimal() + 
    theme(legend.position = "none",
          panel.grid.major.x = element_blank()) 

```

Looks like Age and PassengerId don't appear to have much effect on survival directly, which is kind of surprising and unsurprising to me, respectfully. PassengerId is really only included here for fun, and I suppose it suggests that the sort of "order" of the training data is apparently random. It does look like the holders of more expensive tickets had better chances though, which makes sense.
